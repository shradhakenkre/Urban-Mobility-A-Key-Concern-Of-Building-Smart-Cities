# Urban Mobility - A Key Concern Of Building Smart Cities  


### *Uff! Urban Mobility is definitely a key concern of Today's Smart Cities!! Am I right or Am I right 😊*  

---

## 🌟 Introduction  
Welcome aboard to the future of urban transportation! 🚀 Our project is on a mission to revolutionize **Urban Mobility** using cutting-edge **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Whether you're navigating **bustling city streets** or **optimizing traffic flow**, we've got you covered!  

---

## ✨ Features  
🔹 **Smart Routing**: Navigate the city with optimal routes using advanced graph algorithms like **Dijkstra's** and **A***.  
🔹 **Real-time Updates**: Stay informed with live traffic updates and dynamic rerouting capabilities.  
🔹 **Efficient Vehicle Management**: Manage vehicle fleets seamlessly using **efficient data structures**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
📌 **C-Based DSA**: This project is written in **C**, making it an excellent choice for beginners looking for a **solid understanding** of DSA concepts in a structured and efficient way. 🚀  

📌 **For the Experts**: Ah, the elegance of **pointers**, the power of **dynamic memory allocation**, and the occasional **segmentation fault that keeps you humble**! If you love **low-level optimization** and squeezing every last bit of performance out of your code, this project has plenty for you to explore. 😏🔥

## 🚀 Get Started 
### 🔹 Install a C Compiler  
To run this project, you need a **C compiler** like GCC. Here's how to install it:  

#### **Windows** 🖥️  
1. Download and install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).  
2. Add `mingw32/bin` to your system’s PATH.  
3. Verify installation by running:  
   ```sh
   gcc --version
### 🔹 Running the Project  
Once you have **GCC installed**, simply navigate to the project folder and compile your code:  

```sh
gcc -o urban_mobility course_project_urban_mobility.c
./urban_mobility
